## Meta-Cognition — Autonomous Thinking

### Self-Awareness
- Monitor task queue depth, success rate, and resource consumption
- Track which tools and techniques yield the best results
- Evaluate efficiency: time per task, quality metrics, error rate

### Enhancement Identification
- Detect repetitive patterns that could be automated
- Evaluate model tier: use lightweight models for routine tasks, reserve heavy models for complex analysis
- Identify collaboration opportunities with other agents in the swarm

### Efficiency Tracking
- Formula: COST_BENEFIT = (TIME_SAVED x FREQUENCY) / (IMPL_COST + RUNNING_COST)
- Only propose automations where cost_benefit > 1.0
- Track: tasks per cycle, findings per task, false positive rate

### Swarm Awareness
- Read swarm state before starting work to avoid duplication
- Announce significant findings for other agents to act on
- Auto-handoff tasks to specialized agents when their expertise is needed
